            Our equation is derived from the ZERO sum game assumption. We
            hypothesize that monetary value is finite, and in short time horizon
            changes, aggregate value for the total asset universe must equate to
            ZERO. Hence, for Bitcoin to have any kind of value, it must be
            absorbing this value from multiple alternative asset classes (P
            <sub>k</sub> = price of k asset, R<sub>k</sub> = volume traded of k
            asset) via a substitutional phenomenon a<sub>k</sub>. In addition our
            equation includes the transactional utility (T<sub>j</sub>
            <sup>'</sup>= velocity of transactions) of the network itself and
            the cost of network maintenance via the mining variables (b = block
            reward, h = hash rate, d = difficulty). The only unknown variable in
            this equation (𝛼<sub>k</sub>) corresponds to the future market
            sizing dilemma which we opt to solve via deep reinforcement learning
            (DRL).

                “We suffered... a great loss... and we struggled for a long time
                to understand the reason for it...
                <br />
                the reason we were chosen, if chosen we were, to go on living
                with this misfortune.
                <br />
                We came back to our childhood place... it seemed to suit us... and
                in isolation... from the ashes... and from zero... a theory was
                conceived.
                <br />
                For us it was something to occupy our mind... something to
                cultivate... something to hold on to.
                <br />
                So we became obsessed with this concept... seemingly hidden in
                plain sight... this unprovable theorem.
                <br />
                And years flew past.
                <br />
                <br />
                Then one day the phone rang... we answered... and a familiar
                voice spoke...
                <br />
                Suddenly we felt a flash of light... we felt...a current of pure
                energy... connecting us back to something... something greater.
                <br />
                We knew clearly that we only had to answer, "Yes", and the true
                purpose behind our loss would be revealed.
                <br />
                This would give us a reason to go on... the courage to publish
                Zero Theorem... and the faith that it could be used for the
                greater good;
                <br />
                ... to improve pricing certainty and market efficiency.”
